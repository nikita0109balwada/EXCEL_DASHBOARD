# 📊 Excel Dashboard: Performance Analysis of State Road Transport Undertakings (SRTUs)

📁 Project Overview
This project showcases an interactive and dynamic Excel Dashboard built using publicly available data from NITI Aayog. The dataset includes multi-year performance statistics of various State Road Transport Undertakings (SRTUs) across India.

The goal is to provide meaningful insights into public transportation efficiency, fleet management, and passenger trends at the state level through visualizations and KPIs.

📌 Dataset Details
Source: NITI Aayog - India

Data Type: Annual Performance Data of SRTUs

Key Columns:

SRTU Name

Financial Year

Fleet Held

Fleet Age

Fuel Efficiency (KMPL)

Passengers Carried

Passenger Kilometres Performed

Staff Strength



🔧 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps
Performed using Excel formulas and manual processing:

Removed rows with missing key metrics (like Fuel Efficiency, Fleet Held, Passenger Kilometres)

Fixed inconsistent data types

Renamed columns for readability (e.g., Passenger Kilometres → Passenger KM)

Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., Country, Notes)

Standardized SRTU names


📊 Dashboard Features
✅ KPIs and Visualizations:
Total Passengers Carried – by SRTU over the years

Average Fleet Age Trend – Year-over-Year line graph

Fuel Efficiency Comparison – Bar chart across SRTUs

Passenger KM per Staff – Efficiency metric

Fleet Held Trend – How fleet sizes evolved over time

Underperforming SRTUs – Fuel Efficiency flags using RAG icons


📌 Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel

Pivot Tables

Slicers & Timelines

Conditional Formatting

Advanced Excel Charts (KPI Cards)

Formulas: IF(), INDEX(), FIND(), TEXT(), SUM(), etc.

PowerPoint (for mockup design)

GitHub (for version control and hosting)
